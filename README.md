# 💻 Responsive Web Design Projects – Custom Implementations

This repository contains my **custom-built versions** of the 4 required projects for the  
✅ freeCodeCamp's [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/).  
Each project is created from scratch with original content, responsive layout, and clean structure.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To practice and showcase real-world responsive UI building skills using only **HTML5** & **CSS3**, while customizing each project beyond just replicating freeCodeCamp's samples.

# 🕊️ Tribute Page – Responsive Web Design Project

This is the **Tribute Page** project built *independently* as part of the [freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/). It represents my skills in building clean, semantic, and responsive web pages with a focus on honoring someone meaningful.

# 🧠 Technical Documentation Page – Responsive Web Design Project

This is the **Technical Documentation Page** built as part of the [freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/). It is designed to resemble real-world developer documentation with a structured layout, accessible navigation, and responsive design — using only **HTML5** and **CSS3**.

## 📄 Project Description

The page serves as a mock technical guide, complete with a vertical sidebar, multiple topic sections, and a scrollable content area. It emphasizes semantic HTML, clean UI structure, and user-friendly navigation.
